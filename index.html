<h2 id="st">Saint Louis, MO</h2> 
</p>
<p>
I have lived in St. Louis all my life. St. Louis is my home town.  My family is here, my kids, my husband and my grandbabies.  St. Louis has a lot to offfer as far as entertainment and sights to see.  We have the arch,  the zoo, the science center and more.  People come from all around to visit us.  We have a rich cultural environment.  I love St. Louis.</p>

<h2 id="lv">Las Vegas, Nevada</h2> 
</p>
<p>
Las Vegas, Nevada, is a great place to visit, lots of sights and sounds.  They have fantastic shows and if you are getting married or renewing vows you can do it all up with an Elvis themed wedding, including the "real" Elvis.  We visited one  of the hotels on the Las Vegas strip, Circus Circus and they had a real circus with rides going on.  All the hotels are themed  hotels with lots to see and do and good food.

As well as my favorite superstar Oprah Winfrey lives there.
